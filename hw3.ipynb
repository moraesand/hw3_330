    "1. If you call fit_transform on the test data with StandardScaler, then it try to pre-process from the test data, and would result to it scaling to the test data. This is bad because you want to scale and have your model learn from the training set and have it apply it to the test sets; if you pre-process with the test sets, then it might lead to scaling differences, resulting in incorrect predictions being made.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. If you do not follow the Golden Rule (not letting the model see the test data during training), then the model's predictions will be biased because the model has already seen the data. Although violating the golden rule will result in higher test scores, they will be inaccurate because it \"cheated\" by already looking at the data beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. One advantage of using sklearn Pipelines is that it prevents the breaking of the golden rule by ensuring that preprocessing steps (e.g., scaling, imputation) are fitted only on the training data and then tested on the test data. Another advantage is that it makes the code much more concise by tying the transformation steps and the model into one object that can be cross-validated and deployed easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Using ColumnTransformer would be appropriate when the dataset contains heterogenous data types (e.g., numerical and categorical) that would require different types of preprocessing (e.g., applying StandardScaler to numerical columns and OneHotEncoder to a categorical column in a single step)."

(Since this question is not autograded, please store the value directly as a number, something like `best_C = 0.001`, if `C = 0.001` is giving you the highest CV score.)
